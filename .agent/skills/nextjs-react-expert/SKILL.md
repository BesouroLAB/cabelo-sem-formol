## 🚀 Quick Decision Tree

**What's your performance issue?**

```
🐌 Slow page loads / Long Time to Interactive

  → Check: Dynamic imports, barrel imports, tree-shaking

🖥️ Slow Server-Side Rendering
  → Read Section 3: Server-Side Performance
  → Check: Parallel data fetching, streaming

🔄 Too many re-renders / UI lag
  → Read Section 5: Re-render Optimization
  → Check: React.memo, useMemo, useCallback

🎨 Rendering performance issues
  → Read Section 6: Rendering Performance
  → Check: Virtualization, layout thrashing

🌐 Client-side data fetching problems
  → Read Section 4: Client-Side Data Fetching
  → Check: SWR deduplication, localStorage

✨ Need advanced patterns
  → Read Section 8: Advanced Patterns
```

## 📊 Impact Priority Guide

**Use this order when doing comprehensive optimization:**

```
1️⃣ CRITICAL (Biggest Gains - Do First):
   ├─ Section 1: Eliminating Waterfalls
   │  └─ Each waterfall adds full network latency (100-500ms+)
   └─ Section 2: Bundle Size Optimization
      └─ Affects Time to Interactive and Largest Contentful Paint

2️⃣ HIGH (Significant Impact - Do Second):
   └─ Section 3: Server-Side Performance
      └─ Eliminates server-side waterfalls, faster response times

3️⃣ MEDIUM (Moderate Gains - Do Third):
   ├─ Section 4: Client-Side Data Fetching
   ├─ Section 5: Re-render Optimization
   └─ Section 6: Rendering Performance

4️⃣ LOW (Polish - Do Last):
   ├─ Section 7: JavaScript Performance
   └─ Section 8: Advanced Patterns
```

## ✅ Performance Review Checklist

Before shipping to production:

**Critical (Must Fix):**
- [ ] No sequential data fetching (waterfalls eliminated)
- [ ] Bundle size < 200KB for main bundle
- [ ] No barrel imports in app code
- [ ] Dynamic imports used for large components
- [ ] Parallel data fetching where possible

**High Priority:**
- [ ] Server components used where appropriate
- [ ] API routes optimized (no N+1 queries)
- [ ] Suspense boundaries for data fetching
- [ ] Static generation used where possible

**Medium Priority:**
- [ ] Expensive computations memoized
- [ ] List rendering virtualized (if > 100 items)
- [ ] Images optimized with next/image
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders

**Low Priority (Polish):**
- [ ] Hot path loops optimized
- [ ] RegExp patterns hoisted
- [ ] Property access cached in loops

---

## ❌ Anti-Patterns (Common Mistakes)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Use sequential `await` for independent operations
- ❌ Import entire libraries when you need one function
- ❌ Use barrel exports (`index.ts` re-exports) in app code
- ❌ Skip dynamic imports for large components/libraries
- ❌ Fetch data in useEffect without deduplication
- ❌ Forget to memoize expensive computations
- ❌ Use client components when server components work

**DO:**
- ✅ Fetch data in parallel with `Promise.all()`
- ✅ Use dynamic imports: `const Comp = dynamic(() => import('./Heavy'))`
- ✅ Import directly: `import { specific } from 'library/specific'`
- ✅ Use Suspense boundaries for better UX
- ✅ Leverage React Server Components
- ✅ Measure performance before optimizing
- ✅ Use Next.js built-in optimizations (next/image, next/font)

## 🎯 How to Use This Skill

### For New Features:
1. Check **Section 1 & 2** while building (prevent waterfalls, keep bundle small)
2. Use server components by default (Section 3)
3. Apply memoization for expensive operations (Section 5)

### For Performance Reviews:
1. Start with **Section 1** (waterfalls = biggest impact)
2. Then **Section 2** (bundle size)
3. Then **Section 3** (server-side)
4. Finally other sections as needed

### For Debugging Slow Performance:
1. Identify the symptom (slow load, lag, etc.)
2. Use Quick Decision Tree above
3. Read relevant section
4. Apply fixes in priority order

## 🎓 Best Practices Summary

**Golden Rules:**
1. **Measure first** - Use React DevTools Profiler, Chrome DevTools
2. **Biggest impact first** - Waterfalls → Bundle → Server → Micro
3. **Don't over-optimize** - Focus on real bottlenecks
4. **Use platform features** - Next.js has optimizations built-in
5. **Think about users** - Real-world conditions matter

**Performance Mindset:**
- Every `await` in sequence = potential waterfall
- Every `import` = potential bundle bloat
- Every re-render = wasted computation (if unnecessary)
- Server components = less JavaScript to ship
- Measure, don't guess
